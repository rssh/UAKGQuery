  UAKGQQuery is a CORBA service for database access, which provide
 effecient high-level model of integration CORBA application with data 
 source.


  Historically, UAKGQuery grew [?] from initial implementation of
 CORBA Query Service, developed by authors in 1998. Then architecture
 of service was significally changed, after analysys of
 common service usage scenarios, centered on performance and 
 convinience of programming. In result we release new product with
 new name and new functionality. The results of research are particularly
 summarized in next

  The work of UAKGQuery is:

   -  to provide universal CORBA API for database access
   -  integrate database transactions into CORBA distributed transaction model.


 Supported platforms:

  Database server - Oracle. InterBase support will be integrated in next
version of UAKGQuery.

  Operation system on server side: Sun Solaris, Linux, Windows NT (porting
 to any posix compatible system is possible).
  Operation system on client side: Sun Solaris, Linux, Windows NT, Windows 95,
 FreeNSD (porting to any posix compatible system is possible)

  ORB: OmniORB-3.0, ORBacus-4.03, TAO-5.1

  Transactions are supported, when ORBacus and ORBacus OTS are used.
